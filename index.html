                                My graphisc design skills and expertise in photoshop plays the biggest role
                                when doing web design. This gives a wire frame of how the actual web will look like.

                                After designing the web I use the wire frame to do the actual development.
                                This is where the actual coding of the front end technologies are done.

                        accelerator programe,interested me because I would get digital and professional skills training, 
                        and become part of the already trained professionals in in Kenya and Rwanda.
